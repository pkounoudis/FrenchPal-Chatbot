# My-chatBot
Rasa project for Master's Course 

a. An experimental chatbot for educational purposes, and more specifically for language learning. I wanted to implement a "language helper" for people who are learning french, and provide
them with 3 tools. A grammar helper, a translator and an exercises' generator. The three main scenarios are described below.

b. First Tool, Grammar Helper. It is implemented with a json database with 4 options. The verbs etre, parler, apprendre and finir (one for each conjugation category). The user chooses a verb
and the bot answers with the verb's conjugation in the Present Tense. 
  Second tool, Translator. It is implemented with the help of ChatGPT 3.5 api. The user gives a text (up to 50 words) in french
and the bot gives the english translation. 
  Third tool, Exercises Generator. Again, this tools is implemented with the help of the ChatGPT 3.5 api. The user chooses the level of difficulty (A2 or B2) and the bot generates a small grammar
exercise.

c. More options regarding the exercises' dificulty level, their genre (either vocabulary or grammar), more verbs in various tenses, help with more grammar phenomena (plural, subjonctif etc) and maybe explore 
some more functionalities. For example, a chatbot could be made that generates history quizzez, answers math questions or even helps with university administration tasks (i.e. paying of tuition fees) and 
has answers for almost all course-related information, including fees, curriculum covered, completion date, etc.
